👋 Hello, I’m Aldric Shaun!
I'm a game developer, XR enthusiast, and project manager-in-training with a passion for creating immersive digital experiences. Currently pursuing a Master’s in International Business Management (Project Management) at Kaunas University of Technology, I bring together my technical background in Unity, C#, and mobile development with leadership experience in multicultural settings.

💻 What I Do
🎮 Game Development: I’ve built everything from 2D combat simulators to VR-based health diagnostics. My thesis, Beyond Visual Range, was a fully functional flight combat simulator developed in 3 months using Unity and Blender—earning a perfect score (10/10).

🧠 XR & Eye Tracking Projects: At Parallax Labs, I worked on cutting-edge VR applications using Tobii Ocumen and Pico XR SDK, helping detect focus-related eye conditions like phoria and creating accessible simulations for neurodivergent users.

📱 App Development: I led the creation of Dorm Buddy, a mobile app that streamlined laundry bookings in student dorms using Flutter and Firebase.

🌍 Project Management & Teamwork: With experience managing Agile workflows in Jira, leading university projects, and holding leadership roles at Erasmus Student Network (ESN KTU), I’ve overseen cross-functional teams, handled event logistics, and managed communications for student organizations.

🎶 When I'm not immersed in the IT world, you'll find me enjoying music from the 80s, especially rock and metal, coding solutions to random problems I think of, or engaging in sports like Football, Volleyball, and Badminton. I'm also an avid reader, particularly enjoying books based on real stories.
